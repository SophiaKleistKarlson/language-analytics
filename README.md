# language-analytics

This repository contains my language analytics portfolio assignments. Please enter the separate folders to see readme's, python scripts, requirements, bash scripts and data for each assignment.

NB: I wasn't sure where (or how, I'm very bad at github) to put the utils folder from the main cds-language github repository, so here's a link to it: https://github.com/CDS-AU-DK/cds-language/tree/main/utils
