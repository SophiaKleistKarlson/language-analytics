**Assignment description:**

Dictionary-based sentiment analysis with Python

Download the following CSV file from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines

This is a dataset of over a million headlines taken from the Australian news source ABC (Start Date: 2003-02-19 ; End Date: 2020-12-31).

Calculate the sentiment score for every headline in the data. You can do this using the spaCyTextBlob ap-proach that we covered in class or any other dictionary-based approach in Python.

Create and save a plot of sentiment over time with a 1-week rolling average

Create and save a plot of sentiment over time with a 1-month rolling average

Make sure that you have clear values on the x-axis and that you include the following: a plot title; labels for the x and y axes; and a legend for the plot

Write a short summary (no more than a paragraph) describing what the two plots show. You should mention the following points: 1) What (if any) are the general trends? 2) What (if any) inferences might you draw from them?

HINT: You'll probably want to calculate an average score for each day first, before calculating the rolling aver-ages for weeks and months.

**General instructions**

For this assignment, you should upload a standalone .py script which can be executed from the command line or a Jupyter Notebook

Save your script as sentiment.py or sentiment.ipynb

Make sure to include a requirements.txt file and details about where to find the data

You can either upload the scripts here or push to GitHub and include a link - or both!

Your code should be clearly documented in a way that allows others to easily follow the structure of your script and to use them from the command line.
