**Assignment description:**

String processing with Python

Using a text corpus found on the cds-language GitHub repo or a corpus of your own found on a site such as Kaggle, write a Python script which calculates collocates for a specific keyword.

The script should take a directory of text files, a keyword, and a window size (number of words) as input pa-rameters, and an output file called out/{filename}.csv

These parameters can be defined in the script itself

Find out how often each word collocates with the target across the corpus

Use this to calculate mutual information between the target word and all collocates across the corpus

Save result as a single file consisting of three columns: collocate, raw_frequency, MI

**General instructions**

For this assignment, you should upload a standalone .py script which can be executed from the command line.

Save your script as collocation.py

Make sure to include a requirements.txt file and your data

You can either upload the scripts here or push to GitHub and include a link - or both!

Your code should be clearly documented in a way that allows others to easily follow the structure of your script and to use them from the command line.
