## Basic scripting with Python

**Description**

Using the corpus called 100-english-novels found on the cds-language GitHub repo, write a Python programme which does the following:

Calculate the total word count for each novel

Calculate the total number of unique words for each novel

Save result as a single file consisting of three columns: filename, total_words, unique_words

**General instructions**

For this exercise, you can upload either a standalone script OR a Jupyter Notebook

Save your script as word_counts.py OR word_counts.ipynb

You can either upload the script/notebook here or push to GitHub and include a link - or both!

Your code should be clearly documented in a way that allows others to easily follow the structure of your script.

Similarly, remember to use descriptive variable names! A name like word_count is more readable than wcnt.
